## Run tests

All tests are located in the `test` folder and are named `test_*.py`. To install necessary dependencies run `pip install -r requirements.txt` in the root folder of the project. To run a test run `python test/<filename> <url to be tested>`. The project also has jest tests located in `__tests_/` and can be runned with `npm run test`.
